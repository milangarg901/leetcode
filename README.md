# LeetCode DSA in C++

Structured LeetCode practice for coding interviews, organized topic-wise.

## Focus

- Interview-oriented problem solving
- Clean and readable C++ solutions
- Consistent revision by topic

## Repository Structure

```text
leetcode/
  topics/
    01-arrays/
    02-strings/
    03-hashing/
    ...
    34-meet-in-the-middle/
```

## How Solutions Are Organized

- Folder: by DSA topic under `topics/`
- File name format: `####-problem-title.cpp`

Examples:
- `0001-two-sum.cpp`
- `0238-product-of-array-except-self.cpp`

## Suggested Solution Template

For each file, keep this order:
1. Problem link/name (short comment)
2. Approach summary (2-4 lines)
3. Time and space complexity
4. Final C++ implementation

## Progress

Total solved: `0`  
Primary language: `C++`

I will update counts and add solved files topic-wise over time.

## Quick Workflow

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: 0001 two-sum (arrays)"
git push
```
